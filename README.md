A zoom clone built using NodeJS,EJS,Socket.io and peerJS.

It is a practice project.
Currently a few minor bugs are there -:
1. User hears his own echo while he speaks.
2. User can't give mic only/cam only permissions. Either both will work or none.
3. Video feed is not updated when a user exits.
4. "Leave meeting" button doesn't work.
5. No option to provide name for each user.
